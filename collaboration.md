Contributions

Initial Design:

Created the first version of the Low-Level Design (LLD), which was later refined and updated by teammate Anuj.

Frontend Development:

Set up the React application from scratch.

Built the navigation page and integrated authentication using Firebase.

Implemented protected routes to ensure secure access.

Designed the layout with sidebar and topbar:

Sidebar: implemented navigation across pages.

Topbar: added a user profile logo with a dropdown card including the logout option.

Backend & Firebase:

Configured the Firebase server and linked it with authentication.

Dashboard Development:

Built the Pomodoro Clock, which:

Tracks Pomodoro session times.

Fetches the latest history from Firebase on page load.

Stores session data and updates statistics.

Created a dashboard to display statistics related to Pomodoro sessions.

Challenges Faced

Design Iterations:

The first version of the LLD needed refinement to align with the teamâ€™s evolving vision.

Collaborated with Anuj to improve the design while maintaining clarity.

Authentication Setup:

Faced difficulties with Firebase authentication flow and protected routes.

Solved by debugging route guards and restructuring the authentication context.

Pomodoro-Firebase Integration:

Challenge: Fetching the latest Pomodoro history and syncing real-time updates.

Overcame by structuring Firestore queries efficiently and implementing proper state management.

Learnings & Outcomes

Learned how to integrate Firebase authentication seamlessly with React.

Understood how to design and manage protected routes for secure navigation.

Gained experience in real-time database integration with Firebase Firestore.

Improved ability to collaborate on LLDs and adapt to changing requirements.

Contributions

LLD & Design:

Created the second version of the Low-Level Design (LLD) with refined structure.

Designed and structured the Figma prototype for the project, enhancing UI clarity.

Frontend Development:

Built the dashboard components with enhanced UI.

Developed the reports section to showcase user productivity data.

Implemented the task management module for creating, updating, and tracking tasks.

Improved the UI/UX across all pages, making the app more user-friendly.

Collaboration & Refinement:

Enhanced existing UI parts to align with modern design practices.

Worked closely with Nidhish to refine workflows, dashboard, and design consistency.

Challenges Faced

UI Enhancements:

Faced difficulty in ensuring a clean and intuitive dashboard design.

Solved by iterating multiple Figma mockups and testing different layouts.

Task Management Module:

Challenge in structuring tasks with different states (pending, completed, ongoing).

Overcame by building a modular React component structure and managing state effectively.

Collaboration with Existing Codebase:

Adapting the second version of LLD into existing implementation required alignment with Nidhishâ€™s initial setup.

Achieved by conducting detailed discussions and ensuring compatibility in flow.

Learnings & Outcomes

Gained practical knowledge in UI/UX design using Figma.

Learned how to enhance existing frontend for usability and design consistency.

Understood state management for task-based systems in React.

Improved ability to collaborate on shared codebases and merge design with development.

ðŸŒŸ Team Collaboration Highlights

Both members contributed significantly to LLD iterations, ensuring the design evolved to meet the projectâ€™s vision.

Nidhish focused on initial setup, Firebase, authentication, and Pomodoro dashboard, while Anuj concentrated on UI/UX, reports, task management, and design enhancements.

The team showed strong collaboration skills by overcoming technical and design challenges through regular discussions and refinements.
